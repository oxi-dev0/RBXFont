 [Uploaded to Toolbox - RBXFont v1.0](https://www.roblox.com/library/11590620323/RBXFont-V1-0). Bundled with the VCR_OSD_MONO font with standard keyboard characters.
 
This Repository contains the Python code that can be used to generate fontsheet images and RBXFont modules.
 
To generate a font, run font_gen.py and follow it's instructions. Once you have the font module ready, just type that Font name into the Font attribute on the RBXFont script. 
 
A more detailed readme on the system will be coming soon. 

More characters can be supported by changing the 'characters' variable on line 27 in font_gen.py, and then building the font.
