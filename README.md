# RBXFont
A system for real-time text labels using custom fonts in roblox. [Toolbox](https://www.roblox.com/library/11590620323/RBXFont-V1-0)
> :warning: **Only** Monospaced Fonts are supported by RBXFont! 
 
This Repository contains the Python code that can be used to generate fontsheet images and RBXFont modules.
 
To generate a font, run font_gen.py and follow it's instructions. Once you have the font module ready, just type that Font name into the Font attribute on the RBXFont script. 
 
A more detailed readme on the system will be coming soon.
