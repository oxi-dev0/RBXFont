# RBXFont
A system for real-time text labels using custom fonts in roblox.

This Repository contains the Python code that can be used to generate spritesheets and RBXFont modules.
The RBXFont system can be found on the toolbox [here](LINK).

To generate a font, run font_gen.py and follow it's instructions. Once you have the font module ready, just type that Font name into the Font attribute on the RBXFont script.

A more detailed readme on the system will be coming soon.

WARNING: This system only supports Monospaced Fonts
